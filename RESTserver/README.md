# Generic REST Server
This server publishes a database table as an ednpoint.

It has methods for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

The code has not been refactored. It needs serious work.

The intent is to set this up as a Server that can publish a table by specifiying a few settings. Want it easy to configure.
